This library uses WebKit style for indentation and format.
It is advisable to auto-format your code before you check-in any changes.

First install clang-format if you don't already have it:
$ sudo apt-get install clang-format

Then run the included script to fix the formatting:
$ ./fix-formatting

You can apply clang-format to a single folder by running the script in
that folder.
